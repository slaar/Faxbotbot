Faxing Meta-bot for KoL and 1st ruby code


WHAT
====

This bot acts as a middleman between the hidden sanctum of PVP strategy and sex-chat that is your clan channel and the chat of a clan you ignore but has a fax machine.  It will request faxes into your sideclan and then deposit them into your main zone.  And it's privately controlled BY YOU so you can only spy on yourself (not quite as sexy).


WHY
===

Faxbots are evil and are reading your clan chat GUARANTEED.  You need this bot, which does NOT do that, to counteract the OTHER bots that for sure do that at every opportunity.  Why are robots evil?  I do not know.  Is this one evil?  No, probably.


HOW
===

Make info.txt and put it in the directory with main.rb.  This file is five lines and is structured like this.  Pretend your shiny new bot's name is JimTheBotLOL and his password is MUGS#1 and your real clan is Masters Of Secret Chats and your side clan is Ignoramus Totalirus (if these are real clans, sry, sry).  info.txt is:

JimTheBotLOL  
MUGS#1  
Masters Of Secret Chats  
masters  
ignoramus  

The last two are what you would type to /whitelist into the two clans.

MORE HOW
========

Now you just insert JimTheBotLOL into your faxbot requests.  Want a Knob Goblin Elite Guard Captain from Faxbot?  Just do: "/w JimTheBotLOL FaxBot kge".  Want a cheap strix from Easyfax? "/msg JimTheBotLOL easyfax cheap strix".  Want something from faustbot?  YOU GET THE IDEA!  This bot only recognizes those three fax providers and you must use monster names that your desired fax provider understands.  It's a middleman.  You are literally putting the man (bot) in the middle of your command to another bot.  

+ Make sure this bot is whitelisted into both clans.  
+ Make sure both clans have a fax machine.  
+ Make sure this bot has a VIP key.  
+ Make sure chat is not tabbed, not ancient, but 'Older' in account settings.
+ Make sure the bot has Faxbot, Easyfax, and Faustbot on friends list.
+ Make me some food I'm hungry.

Don't think too hard about how all this is just robots talking to other robots.  That's part of how daily life works in 2014 (and beyond).

Also the code is bad and I'm bad but if you are better you can make the code better too.
